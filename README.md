It is a fun team game. Player 1 can role the dice until the result equals 1. So try to hold your results to save your score:) If the result is equal to 1 , then the first player will be replaced by the second player , who will start roll the dice and the same conditions will apply to him(her) too. The player who reaches the 100 points first , will win the game.
